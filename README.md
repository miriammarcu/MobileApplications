# In this world there is always a story. Here it is the story of this application:

The application is an event manager for people in the Christian community. It has two types of users: admin and client. 
After logging in the CLIENT user is met with a list of events such as choir rehearsal, meeting with the young, celebrations. The user can mark as going to one or more of the these events. 

After joining an event the user will receive an e-mail with details of the rehearsals, like hour and location of the event,maybe the score (if the client want to enlist in the choir).

The ADMIN user can create diffrent events, change existing details,delete them. If an event is deleted, all users who marked that they want to participate in it will be notified via email.
